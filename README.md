# Centre-back efficiency

A new way of valuing defenders, using probabilistic graphical models.

Assessing central defenders is one of the biggest challenges in the statistical study of football.

Here, I propose a method using a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) to assign credit to individual players for the team defensive performance.

The model presented here is a first draft, and subject to further development and improvements.

## How it works

Define team defensive performance

Assign credit to who was on the pitch (at CB)

[Add factor graph]


### Model assumptions

* CB ability
* CB performance
* Team performance
* Opposition attacking ability

## Why this approach is a good one (in my opinion)

Bayesian approach allows integration of prior beliefs (eye test knowledge) with statistical learning

Custom model for this problem - clear assumptions

Framework with ability to extend

Highights ucertainty - express CB ability as a distribution

## The data

Stats bomb open data

FAWSL season data
